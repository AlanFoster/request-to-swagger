# Request To Swagger

## Assumptions

* This tool only generates Swagger 2.0 as at the time of writing, most client generation
  does not support Swagger 3.0
* This tool will try to differentiate between integers and numbers,
  but this may not always be right due to JavaScript's type limitations
* The Null value is not supported
